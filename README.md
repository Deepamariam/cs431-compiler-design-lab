KTU CS431 COMPILER DESIGN LAB

EXPERIMENT 1: 

Design and implement a lexical analyzer for given language using C and the lexical
analyzer should ignore redundant spaces, tabs and new lines.

EXPERIMENT 2:

Write program to implement Deterministic Finite Automata(DFA).

EXPERIMENT 3:

Write program to implement Non-deterministic Finite Automata(NFA).

EXPERIMENT 4:

Write program to convert NFA to DFA.

EXPERIMENT 5:

Construct a recursive descent parser for an expression.

EXPERIMENT 6:

Implement intermediate code generation for simple expressions.

EXPERIMENT 7:

Write program to identify floating point number and string integer using Lex.

EXPERIMENT 8:

Write program to count number of characters, words, space, and number using Lex.

EXPERIMENT 9:

Write a LEX program to remove single line and multiline comments.

EXPERIMENT 10:

Implementation of Calculator using YACC.

EXPERIMENT 11:
